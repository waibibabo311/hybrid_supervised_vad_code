# 01_ubnormal_pre_process

The module code is for the preprocessing of the UBnormal dataset
(1) Process the UBnormal dataset into the organizational form compatible with the hybrid supervised framework proposed in this paper
(2) Process the UBnormal dataset into the video organization format required by the mmdetection object detection framework for training the supervised anomaly localization module

# 02_supervised_VAD_based_on_mmdetection_train

The module code is a supervised anomaly region localization module trained based on the mmdetection object detection framework

# 03_supervised_VAD_based_on_mmdetection_test

The module code is designed to test the performance of the supervised anomaly region localization module based on the mmdetection object detection framework

# 04_hybrid_supervised_VAD

This module code is the main implementation code of the hybrid supervision framework proposed in this article
